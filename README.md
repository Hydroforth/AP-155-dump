## Computer Methods in Physics I 
Verbatim Course Description: "Number systems and number representations; overview of computer hardware and software; computer programming methods; numerical analysis; research data processing; introduction to numerical simulation and modeling"

Contains modules tackled from the Applied Physics 155 class under Ma'am Reinabelle Reyes, PhD and Sir Rene Principe Jr:
1. Python Programming for Physicists
2. Integrals and Derivatives
3. Solutions of Linear and Nonlinear Equations
4. Fourier Transforms
5. Ordinary Differential Equations
6. Partial Differential Equations

Was supposed to contain a 7th module on Monte Carlo Methods, but I never got around to finishing that because it was no longer required. Still glad I got to learn it eventually in AP 157 (see [AP-157-dump](https://github.com/Hydroforth/AP-157-dump)).
