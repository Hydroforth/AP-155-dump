The class has the instance variables `lowerB`, `upperB`, `function`, `accuracy`, `I_list`, and `error_list`. The variables `lowerB` and `upperB` represent the lower and upper bounds of integration, respectively. The `function` variable stands in for the integrand. The `accuracy` variable stands in for the accuracy we are aiming for when calculating using the adaptive trapezoidal rule. The `I_list` and `error_list` variables keep track of the integral estimates and error values, which will be useful for graphing Error vs N slices.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The adaptive trapezoidal rule calculates the $i$th estimate of the integral via the equation $$ I_i = \\frac{1}{2}I_{i-1} + h_i \\sum_{k=\\text{odd} \\\\ 1...N-2} f(a+kh_i) $$\n",
    "    , with the first integral estimate $I_1$ being calculated by the normal trapezoidal rule (which has already been coded in Problem #1.1). Each subsequent calculation $I_i$ doubles the number of slices `N` and makes use of the fact that the previous integral estimates are already embedded in the integral estimate of the doubled `N`, and we only have to account for the summation term with odd $k$. This is done by calling the same function `intTR` in Problem #1.1 but with the `adaptive` argument set to`True`, which then returns the second term in the RHS of the equation above (of course, we are also doubling the value of `N` with each subsequent calculation of $I_i$). Each estimate of $I_i$ also has an associated error $\\epsilon_i$ inherent within the trapezoidal rule, and this error is calculated using a practical equation with respect to the previous estimate $I_{i-1}$ $$ \\epsilon_i = \\frac{1}{3}(I_i - I_{i-1})$$\n",
    "    As such, we will only be calculating errors associated with the 2nd and above integral estimates (i.e. $i$>2).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    I've also defined a new function `function2` to return the value of the new integrand given above per argument `x`. This is the new function we pass on to the `aintTR`'s `function` parameter.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    I'll first be explaining the `approximate` function which calculates the integral to a desired accuracy set by the `accuracy` instance variable. Firstly, we reset the instance variables `I_list` and `error_list` to make sure that we are getting freshly calculated integral estimates and error values, respectively. Afterwards, we calculate the first integral estimate `I_current` using the function defined in Problem #1.1 `intTR` and append the value of `I_current` to `I_list`. We then check for the error of the 2nd integral estimate <b>without</b> explicitly doubling our function variable `N`. If the error for the `2nd integral` is less than the target accuracy value, then `I_current` is probably a good estimate for your integral.<sub>[1]</sub> \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The error is checked using the `erroraTR` function, which takes the arguments `I_prev` and `I_current` as the previous and current estimates of the integral, and then calculates the value using the equation for $\\epsilon$ given above.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If our value `I_1` is not good enough, then the program goes through the `while` loops with the condition that `error` is greater than the instance variable `accuracy`. This will then proceed to calculate and store the next integral estimates and errors<sub>[2]</sub> using the equations above, until `error` which is the error associated for the current estimate $I_i$ is less than the target accuracy given by the instance variable `accuracy`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Lastly, the `output` function just prints out each calculated integral and their associated error (only $I_1$ has no associated error since it cannot be calculated using the equation above). This is done by using a string variable `myString` and looping  through the lists `I_list` and `error_list`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <sub>[1] This was really only done to account for line polynomials. In such a case, the trapezoidal function will be able to perfectly/almost perfectly calculate the integral at the first try using the normal trapezoidal rule.</sub>\n",

    "    <sub>[2] Each integral estimate is saved to `I_list` and each error is saved to `error_list`.</sub>\n",

    "2. Here I've defined a class called `intRI` with class methods used to calculate the integral of a function using the Romberg integration method. The class has the instance variables `lowerB`, `upperB`, `function`, and `accuracy`. The variables `lowerB` and `upperB` represent the lower and upper bounds of integration, respectively. The `function` variable stands in for the integrand. The `accuracy` variable stands in for the accuracy we are aiming for when calculating using the Romberg integration method. The `I_list` and `error_list` variables keep track of the integral estimates and error values, which will be useful for graphing Error vs N slices.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Romberg integration method is summarized in this diagram (taken from Newman):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <img src = \"RImethod.png\" width = \"300\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The first entry of each row $\\left(R_{i,1}\\right)$ is calculated using the normal trapezoidal rule (which has already been coded in Problem #1.1). Subsequent integral estimates allow us to calculate values which have been normally been \"shaved off\" by the trapezoidal function, and therefore allow us to get more accurate estimates of the integral. The $i$ in each row's $I_i$ stands for the doubling of `N` slices starting from `N` = 1, and so each row can be thought of having $2^{i-1}$ slices. The next entries $R_{i,m+1}$ in each row are then calculated using the equation\n",
    "    $$R_{i,m+1} = R_{i,m} + \\frac{1}{4^m - 1}\\left( R_{i,m} - R_{i-1,m}\\right)$$\n",
    "    and the error associated with $R_{i,m}$ is\n",
    "    $$\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{4^m - 1}\\left( R_{i,m} - R_{i-1,m}\\right)$$\n",
    "    This also means that each row can only be made more accurate up to $i-1$ times, since it is dependent on the previous row's values. Also, the Romberg integration method does not give the associated error with the last term in each row. Note that we can also rewrite $R_{i,m+1}$ as\n",

    "    \n",
    "    I'll first be explaining the `approximate` function which calculates the integral to a desired accuracy set by the `accuracy` instance variable. Firstly, the instance variables `I_list` and `error_list` are reset to ensure that we are storing freshly calculated integral estimates and error values, respectively. Then, we calculate the first integral estimate `I_current` for the first row $I_1$ using the `intTR` function defined in Problem #1.1 and append `I_current` to the list of integral estimates `I_list`. We then check for the error of the 2nd integral estimate <b>without</b> explicitly doubling our function variable `N`. If the error for the `2nd integral` is less than the target accuracy value, then `I_current` is probably a good estimate for your integral.<sub>[1]</sub> \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The error is checked using the `errorRI` function, which takes the arguments `R_a`, `R_b`, and `m` where `R_a` and `R_b` are integral estimates with the same $m$ for which we can calculate the error value using the equation for $\\epsilon$. In the diagram, `R_a` and `R_b` would be in the same column, with `R_b` being the integral estimate with the larger `N`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If the absolute value of the error of the 2nd integral estimate is larger than the desired accuracy set by the `accuracy` instance variable, then we will continually loop and calculate further integral estimates and errors<sub>[2]</sub> using the equations above until the desired accuracy is reached.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Lastly, the `output` function just prints out each calculated integral and their associated error (the last integral estimate per row has no associated error value). This is done by using a string variable `myString` and looping  through the lists `I_list` and `error_list`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <sub>[1] Once again, this was really only done to account for line polynomials.</sub>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <sub>[2] The integral estimates and error values are stored into the instance variables `I_list` and `error_list`</sub>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    I then create an instance of the class `intRI` named `myintRI` with the arguments `0`, `1`, `function2` and `10**-6`, and then call the functions `approximate` and `output`."

    "\n",
    "_Refer to Exercise 5.10 of the Newman text._ Consider an anharmonic oscillator with potential $V(x)$ symmetric about $x = 0$. Let us set our anharmonic oscillator going with amplitude $a$. That is, at $t = 0$ we release it from rest at position $x = a$ and it swings back towards the origin. Then at $t = 0$ we have $dx/dt = 0$ and the equation for its total energy becomes $E = V(a)$, i.e., the total energy of the particle is given in terms of the amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the particle reaches the origin for the first time, it has gone through one quarter of a period of the oscillator. The period $T$ is given by: $$ T = \\sqrt{8m} \\int_0^a \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{V(a)-V(x)}}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Suppose the potential is $V(x) = x^4$ and the mass of the particle is $m = 1$. Write a Python function that calculates the period of the oscillator for given amplitude a using Gaussian quadrature with $N = 20$ points. Describe each step clearly and concisely. *(16 pts.; 8 pts. for the code & 8 pts. for the discussion text)*\n",

    "2. Use your function to make a graph of the period for amplitudes ranging from $a = 0$ to $a = 2$. Describe the behavior you find and explain these results clearly and concisely. *(14 pts.; 7 pts. for the plot & 7 pts. for the discussion text)*"

The `period` function maps the weights and appropriate x values using the `gaussmap` function for $N = 20$ slices, from 0 to an argument `a`. Afterwards, the integral is calculated using the Gaussian quadrature method and summed to `intGQ2`. The function then returns `intGQ2` multiplied by the constant $\\sqrt{8m}$."
